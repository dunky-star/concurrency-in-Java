1. A process - is a unit of execution that has its own memory space. Each instance of a JVM runs as a process but isn't true 
   for all JVM implementations. When we run a Java console app, we're kicking off a process.
   If one Java app is running and we run another one, each application has its own memory space of HEAP. The heap isn't shared between them.
   
2. A Thread - is a unit of execution within a process. Each process can have multiple threads. In Java, every process (or app)
   has atleast one thread. Infact, just about every Java process also has multiple system threads that handle tasks like memory management,
   and I/O. We, the developers, don't explicitly create and code those threads. Our codes run in the main thread, or in other thread that we 
   explicitly create.
